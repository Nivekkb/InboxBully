# InboxBully 🛡️

**Protect your nervous system. Reclaim your inbox.**

InboxBully is a human-first safety layer for your email, designed to neutralize predatory marketing, filter emotional triggers, and provide a calm, controlled workspace. Originally built as a gift for the BillBully community, it represents a foundational shift toward technology that respects human autonomy and emotional well-being.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy

We believe your inbox should be a tool for your life, not a weapon used against your nervous system. InboxBully is built on three pillars:
1. **Calm Power**: Technology should reduce stress, not create it.
2. **Protector Energy**: We actively defend you against manipulative marketing and predatory financial tactics.
3. **Human-First**: You are always in control. We provide the guardrails; you make the decisions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Unsubscribe Defense**: Automatically identifies and neutralizes predatory subscriptions and manipulative marketing funnels.
- **Emotional Safety Filters**: Routes stress-inducing emails (debt threats, guilt-based marketing) to a "Handle When Ready" space.
- **AI-Assist Magic Layer**: An intuitive interface where you can simply say what you want (e.g., "Clean this inbox like a calm friend would") and InboxBully executes safely.
- **Human-First Guardrails**: We NEVER delete financial, government, legal, or identity emails without explicit confirmation.
- **Instant Undo**: Every action is reversible. Every decision is logged in plain English.

## 🔒 Trust & Privacy

Your trust is our most sacred asset.
- **Data Sovereignty**: We don't sell, rent, share, or trade your data. Period.
- **Dignity**: Your financial situation is personal. We treat it with the dignity it deserves.
- **Transparency**: No hidden algorithms. You see exactly why an email was flagged or filtered.
